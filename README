this is a unofficial fork of master branch from slackbuilds.org's
git repository (http://slackbuilds.org/cgit/slackbuilds/).

here I put my unofficial mods to their slackbuilds to run on
slackware-current with sbopkg (http://www.sbopkg.org).

Check https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/wiki for additional informations.

See https://github.com/Ponce/slackbuilds/wiki/configuring-the-current-repository-with-sbopkg
for instructions on how to use this repository with sbopkg.
