many criteria, view graphical trends, and produce printable reports
on players and openings. There are many more features as well. With

Place them in the same directory of the source and the will be included
in the package. 

Please see the manpage (man scid) for Slackware-specific information
regarding the opening books permissions.

This SlackBuild does not build the two engines shipped with Scid, togaII
and phalanx, because it places them in a non-standard directory and they
are full-featured stand-alone programs. You should instead use the build
scripts provided for them and Stockfish here at SlackBuilds.org.

Optional dependencies (for sound, advanced graphics and correspondence
chess): tDOM, the Img package (tkimg) and Snack sound package. These
packages are *not* required for the build and are searched and loaded
when the program starts. If not found, Scid simply disables these
features.
