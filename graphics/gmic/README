gmic (image processing framework)

G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image
processing. It provides several different user interfaces to
convert/manipulate/filter/visualize generic image datasets, ranging from
1d scalar signals to 3d+t sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images,
thus including 2d color images.

This package contains the gimp plug-in.

To compile in slackware-current the official package FFTW must be
compiled with cmake to create missing FFTW3LibraryDepends.cmake.
