OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides a common set of
APIs for developing XR applications that run across a wide range of
AR and VR devices. This reduces the time and cost required for
developers to adapt solutions to individual XR platforms while also
creating a larger market of easily supported applications for device
manufacturers that adopt OpenXR.
