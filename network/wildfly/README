WildFly is a free, open source, Java EE 8 and Jakarta EE 8 certified platform
for developing and deploying enterprise Java applications, Web applications,
and Portals. WildFly Application Server provides the full range of Jakarta
EE 8 features as well as extended enterprise services including clustering,
caching, and persistence.

WildFly requires a "wildfly" user and group; create these before
running the SlackBuild script. Examples:

# groupadd -g 282 -r wildfly
# useradd -u 282 -M -r -s /bin/bash -d /usr/share/wildfly \
    -c "WildFly Application Server" -g wildfly wildfly
