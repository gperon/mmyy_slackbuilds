GnuCash is personal and small-business financial-accounting software,
freely licensed under the GNU GPL and available for GNU/Linux, BSD,
Solaris, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible, GnuCash
allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses.
As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based
on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and
accurate reports.

Pass OFX="yes" for OFX (USA) (requies libofx)

Pass AQ="yes" to enable aqbanking (Germany) (requires aqbanking)

Pass WITHPYTHON="yes" to enable Python bindings for report gereration.

If you want the SQL database integration, you must first have libdbi
and libdbi-drivers installed and pass DBI="yes" to the build script.

The script now incudes an option to build with ninja.  To use this
option, make sure ninja is installed and pass NINJA="yes" to the
build script.

NOTE:  You must remove any previous installation of Gnucash before
running this script, otherwise the build will most likely fail.

This script builds version 3.11.  If you need the old stable 2.6.x
series, please use gnucash-legacy, also available on SBo.

Please note version 3.11 will be the last for Slackware 14.2.
Version 4.x will NOT build on 14.2 because of outdated dependencies
(gcc, cmake, and glib2 among others).

NOTE FOR CURRENT/15.0

If you are building on current (15.0 EXPERIMENTAL), you will need the
guile2.2 package from Ponce's -current repo.  Alternatively, you can
download version 4.1 or later from the gnucash website and build that
by passing VERSION=4.(1 or later) to the script without having to
install guile2.2.  (Version 4.0 still requires guile2.2.)
