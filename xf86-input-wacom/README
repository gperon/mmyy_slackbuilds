This package provides the X.Org X11 driver for Wacom and Wacom-like tablets.
It obsoletes the linuxwacom driver and supports X server versions 1.7 and
higher. Server versions lower than 1.7 may be supported by this driver, but
users are encouraged to use the old linuxwacom driver instead.

Requires input-wacom package
